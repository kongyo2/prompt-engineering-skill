## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
```
For each quality dimension:
1. Read through the prompt completely
2. Score against rubric (1-5)
3. Note specific issues found
4. Identify improvement opportunities
```

### Step 2: Weighted Scoring
```
Assign weights based on use case:

High-Stakes (medical, financial, legal):
- Robustness: 30%
- Clarity: 25%
- Completeness: 20%
- Consistency: 15%
- Others: 10%

Creative Tasks:
- Effectiveness: 30%
- Clarity: 20%
- Efficiency: 20%
- Others: 30%

Production Systems:
- Robustness: 25%
- Maintainability: 25%
- Efficiency: 20%
- Others: 30%
```

### Step 3: Testing Protocol

**Test Suite Design:**
```
1. Baseline Test (expected input)
2. Edge Case Tests:
   - Minimum valid input
   - Maximum complexity
   - Boundary conditions
3. Error Tests:
   - Invalid input
   - Missing information
   - Contradictory requirements
4. Variation Tests:
   - Different phrasings
   - Alternative formats
   - Unexpected combinations
```

### Step 4: Results Analysis

**Performance Matrix:**
```
| Test Case | Expected | Actual | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Baseline  | [...]    | [...]  | ✓/✗       | [...] |
| Edge 1    | [...]    | [...]  | ✓/✗       | [...] |

```

### Step 5: Improvement Recommendations

**Priority Matrix:**
```
High Impact + Easy: Do immediately
High Impact + Hard: Plan for next version

```

## Quality Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

**Token Efficiency Ratio (TER):**
```
TER = Output Quality / Token Count
Higher is better
```

**Consistency Score (CS):**
```
CS = Successful Runs / Total Runs
Target: >0.95 for production
```
